# Principal Component Analysis
I'll explain the steps involved in PCA with codes without implemeting scikit-learn.In the end we'll see the shortcut(alternative) way to apply PCA using Scikit-learn.The main aim of this tutorial is to explain what actually happens in background when you apply PCA algorithm.

# Detail-analysis-of-Support-Vector-Machine
We are  going to run Support Vector machine with different kernels(linear,gaussian,polynomial) and also tune the various parameters such as C ,gamma and degree to find out the best performing model . We'll go into deep and detail analysis of SVM and see how tuning of the parameters affects the model.
